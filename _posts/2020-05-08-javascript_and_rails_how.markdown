It's that time again!  Project time!  Through this journey with Flatiron School I have learned alot to say the least.  It's been exilarating and tough at the same time.  I've noticed my largest growth comes from the end of the module project.  This particular project was the most complicated thus far so i had to rely on some outside resources to be able to complete it.  Although tedious, it was well worth the time and effort.  

To give a little perspective here, going into this journey, I came from zero.  By zero, what i mean is that i had zero experience in any kind of coding or design.  So I would consider myself, at the start of Flatiron's curriculum, a kindergartener.  I've tried to not compare myself to those who had any kind of prior experience although difficult not to do so.  This all being said, i'm going to provide some of my favorite outside resources that i used to complete my Javascript/Rails project.

I've found these websites to be amazing resources that helped a newbie, like myself, a great headstart and also to see what IS possible as you move forward in your schooling and eventual career.  I'm sure i will be adding to this list as I go along--very exciting!  Happy Coding!!!!!
