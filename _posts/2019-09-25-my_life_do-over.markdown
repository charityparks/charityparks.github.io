This year I have a birthday with a zero in it!  It has been a great time to reflect on my life so far.  I've been a college student who never finished. I've worked in Corporate America. I've been a stay-at-home mom with with my 2 kids who are now 19 and 21.  I've been in Direct Sales for years and years.  I now look at my life as if I am entering a new phase.  Really reevaluating what i can contribute to my family and society. Asking myself questions like, "Who am I now?", and "What kinds of things interest me?".  And so enters Career Karma.  And here is what happens next...

A little backstory... my 19 year old son is always on Twitter.  I've always been a Facebook girI and had no idea how Twitter even worked.  One afternoon I decided to log into Twitter to see what it was all about.  I read something about a software engineering online community called Career Karma!  I looked into it and soon found out that i could go to an online software engineering school with no money upfront!!! I didn't even know this was a 'thing'!

Fast forward a month later.  I am now enrolled in the online Software Engineering Program at The Flatiron School!  I couldn't be more excited about this next phase in my life! It feels like a lifeline to me, something that interests me and something that will be profitable!
