This is my first project and it was a doozy!! I had no idea of what to expect as this is only my second month of coding. As I struggled through the labs leading up to the start of the project I grew increasingly uncertain if I was going to be able to get through this program at all. What I found is that I have learned so very much in the first two months. My CLI Project really forced me to reach outside and admit I was confused and to seek help. I'm so much better for it. This project has opened my eyes to alot of possibilities in this type of career!
