My Sinatra project is complete!  I was pretty excited AND intimidated by this project.  I struggled through the Restful Routes but looked back in the labs and lessons and had plenty of examples to pull from.  I watched Youtube videos that were suggested that were amazing also.  So here is what i came up with...

I decided that since my son and I love listening to podcasts and we always struggle to remember what episodes were the best ones so that we could listen to them again, that I would make my first web application about My Favorite Podcasts!  Through using Ruby, CSS, HTML, Sinatra, ActiveRecord and more I created an app where users could Sign Up, Log In, Add/Edit and/or Delete their own favorite podcasts!   The user logs in and can add the Podcast Name, Podcast Episode #, Host and Episode Name.  They can only edit and delete their own entries!  

I can't possibly be the only person who had this struggle with their podcast episodes.  So now there is a place we can all list our favorites!  i'm certain I will be updating this web application from time to time with more bells and whistles, but for now, I LOVE IT!  And on a side note, i'm realizing that I really love front-end developing...
